# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The earthquake data is plotted on maps in relation to the position of the tectonic plates on the globe, as well as the magnitude of each occurrence. The goal of this project is to aggregate earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, produce interactive maps of earthquakes around the world, and study them.

## Resources
Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 6.2.0
